### Commentary
01. starting off on the right foot, annoyed I couldn't figure out a way to use one function for both solutions!
02. nice
03. ok
04. accidentlly skipped the last line of the file. that wasted an hour of my life.
05. part b was so straightforward it was confusing
06. 
07. first ever tree traversal. this was painful. solutions aren't too bad but they FOREVER. part 2 was a day behind.
08. nice. part 2 was a day behind :(
09. very project euler - esque. back on track!
10. part 2 was hard. my solution was so so ugly. the elegant DP solutions I found online were soooooooo much better, jee
11. having done sudoku, i gained valuable grid skills that made this ezpz.
12. once I figured the cloclwise / counter clock wise rotation matrix it wasn't so bad
13. today we learn about chinese remainder theorum! hopefully useful for a project euler eventually.......
14. pretty brute force-y but no real hang ups which is nice.
15. HA! part 2 punished me for being lazy on part 1....
16. my solution is soooooo ugly but too busy to clean up
17. day late cuz work is busy :(. solution isn't clever but is very clean. am happy. 
18. shunting algorithm & RPN. the tediousness of debugging made this really hard. also so many inserts & pops hurts my brain.
19. this took me a few days. was awful. tapping out lol. I'll try to finish these in due time. I was on pace till #19 lol
20. I was keeping up until part2 here. took me almost a week. p2 wasn't that hard just a lot of crap to do lol.
21. tht was easy.
22. p1 ez. doing p1s for now.
23. I spent about an hour learning that circles go in a circle.... p2: amazing how tweaking data structures can take this from totally intractable to a couple of seconds.... also baby's first linked list.
24. Love finding something like hexagonal coordinates. Something I have spent 0 time thinking about but also something some people have spent ALOT of time thinking about. p2 was pretty easy. runs very slowly. should have used a dictionary to hold the board. oh whale. 
25. these p1's really arent that bad.
