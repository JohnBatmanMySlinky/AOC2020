### Commentary
1. starting off on the right foot, annoyed I couldn't figure out a way to use one function for both solutions!
2. nice
3. ok
4. accidentlly skipped the last line of the file. that wasted an hour of my life.
5. part b was so straightforward it was confusing
6. 
7. first ever tree traversal. this was painful. solutions aren't too bad but they FOREVER. part 2 was a day behind.
8. nice. part 2 was a day behind :(
9. very project euler - esque. back on track!
10. part 2 was hard. my solution was so so ugly. the elegant DP solutions I found online were soooooooo much better, jee
11. having done sudoku, i gained valuable grid skills that made this ezpz.
12. once I figured the cloclwise / counter clock wise rotation matrix it wasn't so bad
13. today we learn about chinese remainder theorum! hopefully useful for a project euler eventually.......
14. pretty brute force-y but no real hang ups which is nice.
15. HA! part 2 punished me for being lazy on part 1....
16. my solution is soooooo ugly but too busy to clean up
17. day late cuz work is busy :(. solution isn't clever but is very clean. am happy.
