# My Advent of Code Solutions

Done in python. Maybe some in R if I'm bored.

* Made it through day 19 mostly on track. Shunting yard algorithm hurt. The rotating boards part2 wasn't hard but took a long time. Chinese remainder theorum was hard but presumably will be helpful for Project Euler. The last couple p2's slowed me down a fair bit too.
