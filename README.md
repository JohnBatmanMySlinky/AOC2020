### Commentary
1. starting off on the right foot, annoyed I couldn't figure out a way to use one function for both solutions!
2. nice
3. ok
4. accidentlly skipped the last line of the file. that wasted an hour of my life.
5. part b was so straightforward it was confusing
6. 
7. first ever tree traversal. this was painful. solutions aren't too bad but they FOREVER.
